# StreamFlix - OTT Digital Media Platform

## Project Overview
The **StreamFlix** is a scalable solution designed for seamless streaming, content delivery, and user engagement. The platform is supported by a robust DevOps pipeline that automates development, testing, deployment, and monitoring processes.

## Features
- Responsive frontend design using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for a user-friendly interface.
- Scalable infrastructure designed with modern DevOps practices.
- Real-time monitoring and efficient resource utilization using advanced tools.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
- **DevOps Tools & Processes**:
  - **Version Control**: GitHub for source code management.
  - **CI/CD**: Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment automation.
  - **Containerization**: Docker for creating and managing containers, DockerSlim for image optimization.
  - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform to provision and manage AWS EKS resources.
  - **Service Mesh & Networking**: Istio for service mesh implementation, Calico for secure and optimized networking.
  - **Code Quality**: SonarQube for static code analysis, Trivy for scanning and testing Dockerfiles.
  - **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring and visualization.

## DevOps Workflow
1. **Version Control**: Code is managed in a GitHub repository.
2. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
   - Jenkins automates the build and deployment process.
   - Each commit triggers the pipeline for building, testing, and deploying.
3. **Containerization**:
   - Docker is used to containerize the application, ensuring consistency across environments.
   - DockerSlim optimizes container images for efficient performance.
4. **Infrastructure Management**:
   - Terraform provisions resources on AWS EKS for scalable and reliable deployments.
5. **Service Mesh & Networking**:
   - Istio enhances communication between microservices.
   - Calico ensures secure networking across the Kubernetes cluster.
6. **Code Quality & Security**:
   - SonarQube provides insights into code quality and detects vulnerabilities.
   - Trivy scans Dockerfiles for potential security issues.
7. **Monitoring**:
   - Prometheus collects metrics for the application and infrastructure.
   - Grafana visualizes the metrics for performance monitoring and troubleshooting.
